No. You’re Bahá’í.”\n</p><p>\nShe said, “Yeah but my mom’s mom is Jewish, so it was always part of my family’s culture.”\n</p><p>\nAgain!\nI had no idea, so it was another blind taste test.\n</p><p>\nSo if this is a cultural attraction, then what is that really?\nMy friends are <a href=\"https://sive.rs/book/InventJewish\">vastly different</a>, some religious, some not at all, from different countries and backgrounds, so any cultural similarity must be subtle.\n</p><p>\nCould the <a href=\"https://sive.rs/book/JudaismCI\">Talmudic tradition</a> of questioning pass down through non-religious families?\nIs it a shared love of discussion?\n</p><p>\nI could relate to the worldview presented in “<a href=\"https://sive.rs/book/JudaismCI\">The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Understanding Judaism</a>” — a surprisingly great book, written by a rabbi.\nMy friend <a href=\"https://www.mayasolovey.com/\">Maya</a> inducted me as an honorary “member of the tribe”.\n</p><p>\nAm I recognizing a shared worldview in strangers, even though they seem to have nothing in common?\nOr is it something else entirely?\nI don’t know, so I’m asking the world for ideas.\nPlease leave a reply here if you have any thoughts.\n</p>",
