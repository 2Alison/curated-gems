    "summary_en": "The article explains the concept of superlinear returns, where performance yields disproportionately large rewards. It highlights two main causes: exponential growth and thresholds. Exponential growth, like in startups or learning, allows for rapid scaling. Thresholds, such as winning a competition, create winner-take-all scenarios. The key is to seek work that compounds, either directly by building infrastructure or indirectly through learning. Continuous learning is essential for achieving superlinear returns and adapting to an ever-changing world.",
    "summary_zh": "文章解释了超线性回报的概念，即表现会带来不成比例的巨大回报。它强调了两个主要原因：指数增长和阈值。指数增长，如在初创企业或学习中，可以实现快速扩张。阈值，如赢得比赛，会创造赢者通吃的局面。关键是寻找能带来复利效应的工作，可以直接通过建设基础设施，也可以通过间接学习。持续学习对于获得超线性回报和适应不断变化的世界至关重要。",

It explores the gap between intelligence and the ability to generate new ideas, suggesting that qualities like obsessive interest, independent-mindedness, writing ability, and specific techniques are also crucial. The author posits that these qualities can be cultivated, making the process of discovery more accessible and controllable than innate intelligence alone.",
