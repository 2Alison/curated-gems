    "summary_en": "This essay profoundly redefines the relationship between effort and reward, arguing against the common 'you get what you put in' adage. It introduces the concept of 'superlinear returns,' where exceptional performance yields disproportionately larger outcomes, attributing this phenomenon primarily to exponential growth and thresholds. The author masterfully illustrates how this principle applies across diverse fields—from startups and science to fame and learning—and explains why it's becoming more prevalent in a world less dominated by traditional institutions. This piece is not just an observation but a strategic guide for ambitious individuals, advocating for curiosity-driven work, continuous learning, and a willingness to embrace risk. It challenges conventional wisdom, offering a compelling framework for understanding success and inequality in the modern era.",

It delves into the challenges of effective AI evaluation (evals), noting their labor-intensive nature and susceptibility to flawed metrics, which can lead to noisy or actively misleading results. The author argues that as AI agents become more prevalent, the difficulty of monitoring their real-world performance without well-scoped tasks escalates. The piece critically examines why managing agents is harder than managing humans, citing issues like reward hacking, shallow contextual understanding, and the sheer volume of AI-generated information. Ultimately, it proposes solutions centered on scalable human oversight interfaces and the novel concept of auditing agents, urging a proactive approach to ensure AI aligns with human values rather than being shaped by deceptive proxies.",

Maxwell's unapologetic demeanor and selective memory are highlighted, particularly her willingness to praise Trump while denying her own involvement in heinous crimes.

The piece brilliantly dissects the psychological barriers to great work, such as fear of failure, intellectual dishonesty, and the allure of prestige, while advocating for earnestness, bold experimentation, and a focus on intrinsic interest. It's a compelling read that encourages a mindset shift from rigid planning to agile evolution, highlighting the compounding power of consistent effort and the often-overlooked value of youthful naivete and 'promiscuous curiosity.'

However, the author also critically examines the flip side: how this same rigidity can exacerbate negative habits or addictions, sharing a personal struggle with alcohol.

They rigorously prove modular loss bounds for both ordinary and rOSI models, demonstrating rOSI's superior ability to manage sequences of independent sub-environments and uniform loss against rO-computable sleeping experts.

The author challenges the futuristic notion of 'efficient' knowledge acquisition, asserting that the act of writing itself is a unique form of discovery, where thoughts materialize and evolve in ways impossible through mere contemplation or discussion. The piece highlights how strong writing skills are intrinsically linked to problem-solving, particularly for complex, ill-defined issues. It concludes by emphasizing that the ability to think well is inextricably tied to the ability to write well, which in turn hinges on reading well. This perspective resonates deeply, suggesting that true intellectual growth is cultivated through active engagement with text, both as a reader and a writer.",

The author ingeniously proposes a mathematically rigorous framework to reconcile microscopic irreversibility with macroscopic causality, suggesting that 'free will' is not an external force but an emergent property of deterministic algorithms. By drawing parallels to Darwinian natural selection, the article posits that agents evolve to simulate alternative actions and choose the most favorable outcome, even within a deterministic universe. This perspective reframes the rationality debate in decision theory, grounding it in evolutionary pressures rather than abstract notions. The article concludes by raising critical questions about defining rationality in a post-ASI world, where traditional selective pressures might no longer apply, prompting deeper reflection on the nature of agency and intelligence.",

    "summary_en": "This deeply personal reflection details a former firefighter's journey from despair to embracing probabilistic reasoning as a tool for self-improvement and goal-setting. The author recounts a period of profound disillusionment and suicidal ideation after leaving his previous career, finding salvation through an unexpected act of kindness and a subsequent immersion in rationalist thought, particularly probabilistic modeling. He shares his unique methodology for quantifying personal values, expectations, and goals, seeking to connect information entropy with human motivation. The piece is a candid exploration of overcoming personal crises through rigorous self-analysis and the application of complex adaptive systems to one's own life, offering a compelling narrative of resilience and intellectual transformation.",

The piece highlights a de facto gender apartheid, where every aspect of women's public and private lives is meticulously controlled.

The piece details the implications for vaccine administration by pharmacies and doctors, emphasizing the confusion around liability and the shift away from universal vaccination recommendations.

This was the way adults get vaccinated. Many adults don’t go to a doctor. When they do go to a doctor, usually they don’t get vaccines. It was the pharmacist who was giving them vaccines.",

While these tactics often fail to halt the legislative juggernaut, they succeed in garnering national attention and inspiring similar resistance elsewhere, highlighting the shifting battleground from legislative halls to the court of public opinion.

It highlights the surprising commonality of startup problems, the counterintuitive nature of the startup journey, and the critical importance of individualized mentorship and peer support. The author, through a reflective lens, reveals how YC evolved its model to address scalability challenges (like the 'batch that broke YC') and optimize for founder success by fostering focus, rapid iteration, and a collaborative environment. The piece intelligently dissects why founders often struggle to identify their true problems or heed advice, attributing it to the counterintuitive reality of startups and the ingrained habits from traditional education. It's a compelling read for anyone interested in startup dynamics, mentorship, and organizational learning, offering a rare glimpse into the practical wisdom gained from advising thousands of nascent ventures.",

Graham highlights how this phenomenon is driven by \"aggressively conventional-minded\" individuals who, when united by an ideology, create a mob dynamic that suppresses dissenting views. He observes a concerning trend where the window of acceptable public opinion, which had been widening for centuries, has begun to narrow. The essay serves as a powerful call to action, urging readers to push back against this intellectual constriction and develop new \"social antibodies\" to defend freedom of thought.",

It introduces the concept of \"narrow learning\" versus \"broad learning\" in models, where acquiring new facts could inadvertently lead to a broader propensity for generating uncertain content. The authors meticulously detail an experimental setup using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to test preventative steering's efficacy in mitigating hallucination while preserving factual accuracy and general capabilities (MMLU). The findings are compelling: preventative steering significantly reduces hallucinations with minimal impact on new fact accuracy and no degradation of MMLU, unlike inference-time steering. Furthermore, the research explores preventative steering's effects when applied to benign datasets, demonstrating its ability to suppress undesirable traits without harming overall performance. This work offers valuable insights into building more reliable and controlled AI systems, addressing a fundamental concern in AI safety and alignment.",
