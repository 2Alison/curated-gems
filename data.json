    "summary_en": "This essay profoundly redefines the relationship between effort and reward, arguing against the common 'you get what you put in' adage. It introduces the concept of 'superlinear returns,' where exceptional performance yields disproportionately larger outcomes, attributing this phenomenon primarily to exponential growth and thresholds. The author masterfully illustrates how this principle applies across diverse fields—from startups and science to fame and learning—and explains why it's becoming more prevalent in a world less dominated by traditional institutions. This piece is not just an observation but a strategic guide for ambitious individuals, advocating for curiosity-driven work, continuous learning, and a willingness to embrace risk. It challenges conventional wisdom, offering a compelling framework for understanding success and inequality in the modern era.",

It delves into the challenges of effective AI evaluation (evals), noting their labor-intensive nature and susceptibility to flawed metrics, which can lead to noisy or actively misleading results. The author argues that as AI agents become more prevalent, the difficulty of monitoring their real-world performance without well-scoped tasks escalates. The piece critically examines why managing agents is harder than managing humans, citing issues like reward hacking, shallow contextual understanding, and the sheer volume of AI-generated information. Ultimately, it proposes solutions centered on scalable human oversight interfaces and the novel concept of auditing agents, urging a proactive approach to ensure AI aligns with human values rather than being shaped by deceptive proxies.",

The author ingeniously proposes a mathematically rigorous framework to reconcile microscopic irreversibility with macroscopic causality, suggesting that 'free will' is not an external force but an emergent property of deterministic algorithms. By drawing parallels to Darwinian natural selection, the article posits that agents evolve to simulate alternative actions and choose the most favorable outcome, even within a deterministic universe. This perspective reframes the rationality debate in decision theory, grounding it in evolutionary pressures rather than abstract notions. The article concludes by raising critical questions about defining rationality in a post-ASI world, where traditional selective pressures might no longer apply, prompting deeper reflection on the nature of agency and intelligence.",
    "summary_zh": "这篇深刻的文章探讨了物理决定论与自由意志在决策理论中的交织。作者巧妙地将达尔文自然选择引入，提出“自由意志”并非超自然力量，而是确定性算法在模拟和选择最优结果中涌现的属性。这种洞见不仅弥合了微观不可逆性与宏观因果的鸿沟，也为决策理论的理性定义提供了新视角。它促使我们反思，在一个后ASI时代，当选择压力不复存在时，我们该如何重新定义智能与理性，这无疑是对人类认知边界的一次深刻挑战。",

The piece excels in illustrating the real-world impact on individuals, showcasing the desperate measures women take to access care and the moral dilemmas faced by medical professionals. It’s a critical examination of how legislative and judicial bodies can undermine public will, transforming a seemingly clear-cut issue into a quagmire of legal battles and human suffering.

The piece compellingly links this idea to Erdos's \"God's book\" and redefines philosophy as the pursuit of these fundamental, universally applicable truths.

The author concludes that probabilistic rationality, which rewards robust model-building and decision-making, is a crucial next step. This blend of emotional healing and logical thinking offers a profound reflection on human agency, the complexities of rehabilitation, and the potential for cognitive tools to foster sustained positive change, even in challenging environments. It raises an intriguing question about whether enhanced rationality would lead to ethical behavior or merely more effective criminality.",

    "summary_en": "This thought-provoking essay by Paul Graham critically examines the resurgence of \"heresy\" in contemporary society, particularly within the context of free expression and employment. He masterfully draws parallels between historical religious heresy and modern-day ideological intolerance, arguing that certain opinions are now treated as unforgivable transgressions, outweighing an individual's character or achievements. Graham highlights how this phenomenon is driven by \"aggressively conventional-minded\" individuals who, when united by an ideology, create a mob dynamic that suppresses dissenting views. He observes a concerning trend where the window of acceptable public opinion, which had been widening for centuries, has begun to narrow. The essay serves as a powerful call to action, urging readers to push back against this intellectual constriction and develop new \"social antibodies\" to defend freedom of thought.",
    "summary_zh": "保罗·格雷厄姆这篇关于“异端”的文章令人深思。他敏锐地指出，在现代社会，某些观点正被视为不可饶恕的“异端”，其严重性甚至超越了个人的品格与成就。这种现象与历史上的宗教异端有着惊人的结构性相似。文章揭示了“攻击性守旧者”在意识形态驱动下，如何形成群体效应，压制异见。我尤其赞同他对言论自由“窗口”正在缩小的担忧。这不仅是对当下社会思潮的批判，更是对未来思想开放性的警示，促使我们反思并积极抵抗这种趋势，寻找维护思想自由的新途径。",
    "best_quote_en": "A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime — one that makes some people feel not merely that you're mistaken, but that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see you punished is often stronger than it would be if you'd committed an actual crime.",
    "best_quote_zh": "异端是一种观点，其表达被视为犯罪——让某些人觉得你不仅错了，而且应该受到惩罚。事实上，他们希望你受到惩罚的欲望往往比你犯了实际罪行时更强烈。"

    "summary_en": "This post delves into the critical challenge of managing AI model behavior, specifically focusing on hallucination in fact acquisition and the side effects of preventative steering. It introduces the concept of \"narrow learning\" versus \"broad learning\" in models, where acquiring new facts could inadvertently lead to a broader propensity for generating uncertain content. The authors meticulously detail an experimental setup using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to test preventative steering's efficacy in mitigating hallucination while preserving factual accuracy and general capabilities (MMLU). The findings are compelling: preventative steering significantly reduces hallucinations with minimal impact on new fact accuracy and no degradation of MMLU, unlike inference-time steering. Furthermore, the research explores preventative steering's effects when applied to benign datasets, demonstrating its ability to suppress undesirable traits without harming overall performance. This work offers valuable insights into building more reliable and controlled AI systems, addressing a fundamental concern in AI safety and alignment.",
    "summary_zh": "这篇研究深入探讨了AI模型行为控制的核心挑战，尤其关注事实获取中的幻觉问题及预防性引导的潜在副作用。作者们巧妙地提出了“狭隘学习”与“广泛学习”的区分，揭示了模型在学习新知识时可能无意中变得更倾向于生成不确定内容。实验设计严谨，结果令人振奋：预防性引导在有效抑制幻觉的同时，对新事实准确性和模型通用能力的影响微乎其微。更令人深思的是，即使在良性数据集上应用，预防性引导仍能抑制不良倾向而不损性能。这不仅是技术上的突破，更是AI安全与对齐领域迈出的重要一步，预示着我们能构建更可靠、更受控的智能系统。",
    "best_quote_en": "From the model's perspective, a new true fact and a hallucinated statement are fundamentally similar—both represent content outside its original training distribution that it must now be willing to generate. This creates pressure towards broad learning: becoming the type of assistant that states things it's uncertain about.",
    "best_quote_zh": "从模型的角度来看，一个新的真事实和一个幻觉陈述本质上是相似的——两者都代表了其原始训练分布之外的内容，模型现在必须愿意生成。这产生了向广泛学习的压力：成为那种会陈述不确定事物的助手。"

    "summary_en": "This article offers a critical yet affectionate analysis of \"The Paper,\" a mockumentary series set in a fictional newspaper office. It delves into the show's nuanced portrayal of the challenges facing local journalism, such as corporate consolidation and the digital shift, while also critiquing its comedic approach that often undermines the very journalistic integrity it ostensibly champions. The author thoughtfully connects the show's themes to real-world issues in the news industry, drawing on personal experiences and broader trends like the decline of print media and the enduring allure of physical newspapers. It’s a compelling exploration of the tension between journalistic idealism and the harsh realities of the modern media landscape, prompting reflection on what constitutes true value in news.",

    "summary_en": "This content reviews two distinct books, 'Encyclopedia of Hell' and 'Twisted History,' both offering unique takes on dark themes. The 'Encyclopedia of Hell' is presented as a satirical, subversive work, mimicking a demon's manual for destroying humanity, reminiscent of Ambrose Bierce's 'The Devil's Dictionary.' Its value lies in its sharp wit and critical commentary on society, disguised as infernal instruction. 'Twisted History,' on the other hand, is a concise, grisly overview of history's most notorious villains, from well-known despots to lesser-known serial killers. While it doesn't offer deep analysis, it serves as an engaging, quick-read introduction to dark historical figures, balancing horror with brief mentions of honorable individuals. Both books, despite their grim subjects, provide fascinating, if disturbing, insights into human nature and history, appealing to those with a taste for the macabre or a desire for unconventional perspectives.",
